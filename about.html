     <p>A native Floridian, I now reside in the Mission Hill neighborhood of
     Boston, Massachussetts.  <br>  I majored in Economics and received a minor
     in Business Administration and Management.  Using the skills I learned in
     college, I started working in the professional yachting industry.  There, I
     worked as a deckhand for a year, maintaining an array of multi-million
     dollar vessels.<br>  Afterwards, I returned to Boston to work as a
     Microenterpise web development intern at the International Institute of New
     England.  There, I helped low income and very low income clients start
     their own small businesses and secure small loans through government
     programs.<br>After leaving IINE, I took a Teaching English as a Foreign
     Language course to receive my TEFL certificate.  Using this certificate, I
     worked at Kaplan International English Schools for over a year.  Just
     recently, I left Kaplan to pursue web development through the ThisIsMetis
     Web Development Program.</p>
